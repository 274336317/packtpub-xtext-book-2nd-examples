Chapter 13, Page 344: the box refers to the initial version of the project for the EMF School model that can be found here: https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/emf-school-model. Such a git repository was empty until today (15 April 2017); sorry, I had forgotten to push such a project.

Chapter 13, Page 379: in the code snippet, the method name "internalToxpression" should be "internalToConvertedExpression" (as said in the text of the paragraph).
